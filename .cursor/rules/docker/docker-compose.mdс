# Project Rules for Docker Compose

name: docker-compose
description: Best practices for writing Docker Compose files and managing multi-container applications.

rules:
  - Always use the `docker compose` command instead of `docker-compose`, as the latter is deprecated in recent Docker versions.
  - Do not include the `version` field in Compose YAML files; it is no longer required or recommended for modern Compose specifications.
  - Use consistent indentation (2 spaces) and lowercase keys in YAML files.
  - Prefer named volumes and networks over anonymous ones for better clarity and reusability.
  - Use `.env` files for environment variables instead of hardcoding them in the `docker-compose.yml`.
