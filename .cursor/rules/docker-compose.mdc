# Docker Compose Best Practices

When working with Docker Compose in this project:

## Command Usage
- Use `docker compose` command instead of `docker-compose` (deprecated in recent Docker versions)

## File Structure
- Omit the `version` field in Compose YAML files (no longer required for modern specifications)
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces) and lowercase keys in YAML files
- Organize services in logical groups

## Resource Management
- Use named volumes over anonymous ones for better clarity and reusability
- Define explicit networks when services need to communicate
- Use meaningful names for services, volumes, and networks

## Configuration
- Store environment variables in `.env` files
- Never hardcode sensitive values in `docker-compose.yml`
- Use build arguments for build-time variables

## Examples

```yaml
services:
  app:
    build: 
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    env_file: .env
    volumes:
      - app_data:/data

volumes:
  app_data:
    name: "${PROJECT_NAME}_app_data"
```
